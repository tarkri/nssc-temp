					<h2><span class="purple" style="text-transform: capitalize;">How to break into the creative world outside of college</span><br /><small>Jordan Wollman, Chief Creative Office & Partner at Aria</small></h2><br />
					<p>In my decade plus of hiring, firing, and managing creative talent, it has always stood out to me how little of what we in advertising do for our clients, we do for ourselves. This session will explain the secret sauce to finding the exact job you want, and what things you're probably being told that will only make your resume (even a great, fancy, amazing one) another resume in a big old stack of resumes.<br /><br />
						Jordan Wollman has, in one way or another, been involved in the creation of brands since his early years, where he spent his days watching his father design everything from corporate identities to brochures, early websites to communication architectures. Jordan has spent his entire professional career (starting at age 14) focusing on branding, brand development, and brand marketing. Jordan once owned a record store, a record label, helped develop a curriculum for a design school in Russia, wrote a book on After Effects, and was the youngest certified LightWave 3D trainer ever. A published author, international speaker, and multiple-time entrepreneur, Jordan's body of work and myriad interest is vast: design, history, politics, architecture, fine woodworking, and of course his loving family, are the obsessions that keep him going. Jordan is Chief Creative Officer and Partner at Aria, a tourism and economic development-focused brand agency.

					<h2><span class="purple" style="text-transform: capitalize">"Designer" is the last thing you wanna be</span><br /><small>Sung Kim</small></h2><br />
					<p>How do you design a product? Do you approach it from a designer's perspective or approach it as the voice of the product? How do you become a voice of the product when you have no expert knowledge in that field of study or industry, for example designing the menu for a sushi restaurant or an app that runs complex mathmatical algorithm. In reality, you know more than you think you do. You just have to be able to recognize the "patterns."<br /><br />
					   <strong>Who is Sung Kim?</strong><br />
					   Deemed 51st Best Designer in Technology in 2013 by Business Insider. Founder of Gestures, Inc. Currently UX/UI Consultant at Samsung. Designer for various startups, including Blownaway, Matter, Olé, and ModelRevolt.

					<h2><span class="purple" style="text-transform: capitalize">How not to suck at presenting your work</span><br /><small>Megan Mead</small></h2><br />
					<p>As a graphic design student, school is teaching you how to create smart, badass work that will hopefully get you hired upon graduating. What it isn’t teaching you, however, is how important it is to be good at presenting that work and how presentation skills can impact your career. In this breakout session you will learn the importance of giving your work the spotlight it deserves, and come away with an array of storytelling strategies and acting techniques that will help you improve your presentation performance. This will be a fun, hands on experience that will help you shake off some of those portfolio review jitters.<br /><br />
Megan Mead is a freelance art director, designer and speaker stationed in Austin, TX. She majored in communication design at the University of North Texas with a double minor in theatre and marketing, giving her a unique view point, straddling the world of performance and design. Trained to better understand vocal, breath and acting exercises, she is very interested in how theatrical training can supplement design education, and has spoken on this topic at several conferences including SXSW 2013, Rise Week Austin and Design Big Week AIGA Dallas. She is also very excited to be speaking at the HOW Design Live conference in May.

					<h2><span class="purple" style="text-transform: capitalize">Analog Techniques in a Digital World</span><br /><small>Kyle Steed</small></h2><br />
					<p>Let’s be honest, the “hand-made” movement is a big trend right now. From letters, to posters, to commercials. It’s everywhere. And what’s the one thing we can count on with trends? They will change. 
<br /><br />
My name is Kyle Steed. I’m an artist, illustrator and professional doodler. I love working for myself and getting to create fun, unique pieces of work that inspire others. I take great honor in working with large clients on national campaigns as much as I do working with small clients in my own neighborhood. It’s my hope that by the end of my session you would start to see another way of approaching your work and the creative process all together — while remembering that your process doesn’t have to look like mine, or anyone else’s, but more importantly finding your own voice and way of doing things that feels natural to you. After the boring part, my talk, is over come prepared to have some fun with drawing on paper. There won’t be any prizes or anything like that, just real people drawing real stuff.

					<p>There are many lessons that you learn in the midst of running your own studio that no school or program could ever teach you. Scott will share some of the more unexpected lessons he's come across over the last decade to shed light on what design entrepreneurship holds in store. Some are sad, some scary, but hopefully most are useful or at the very least funny.
<br /><br />
Scott is the principal of Studio Mast based in Denver, CO. He has been helping brands tell their stories for the better part of a decade. Originally from Oklahoma, Scott has now planted roots in the Rockies and if not designing is probably on the mountain or with his beautiful wife Ashlee and their dogs, Eames and Rilo.
