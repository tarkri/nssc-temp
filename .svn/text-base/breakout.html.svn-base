					<h2><span class="purple">How Not 2 Suck at Presenting Your Work</span><br /><small>Megan Mead, Freelance Art Director, Designer & Speaker</small></h2><br />
					<p>As a graphic design student, school is teaching you how to create smart, badass work that will hopefully get you hired upon graduating. What it isn't teaching you, however, is how important it is to be good at presenting that work and how presentation skills can impact your career. In this breakout session you will learn the importance of giving your work the spotlight it deserves, and come away with an array of storytelling strategies and acting techniques that will help you improve your presentation performance. This will be a fun, hands on experience that will help you shake off some of those portfolio review jitters.
<br /><br />
Megan Mead is a freelance art director, designer and speaker stationed in Austin, Texas. She majored in communication design at the University of North Texas with a double minor in theatre and marketing, giving her a unique view point, straddling the world of performance and design. Trained to better understand vocal, breath and acting exercises, she is very interested in how theatrical training can supplement design education, and has spoken on this topic at several conferences including SXSW 2013, Rise Week Austin and Design Big Week AIGA Dallas.

Let's talk about that.<br />
Let's talk soon.<br />
See you on Saturday at 2pm<br />
<br />
And if possible, bring a plastic spoon too. Please.<br /><br />

Peter Wood is a Typographer. Designer. Art Director. Creative Director. Mentor and Teacher. His magical journey, which includes traditional and digital, began in London over 25 years ago. Many of Peter's fun adventures have taken him from Saatchi & Saatchi, HKR, Yellowhammer, WCRS and Howell Henry in London to Ogilvy, Euro, Martin, Goodby and Slingshot in the US.
<br /><br />
His passion begins and ends with opportunity. 
<br /><br />
As a teacher and speaker, Peter has taught and lectured in the UK at Buckinghamshire College of Art, Hull University, Southampton College of Art and St Martins in London.

Ranging from twenty to over 700 people. The joy of a lot of these talks has been speaking to people outside of marketing too. And the joy of Peter himself learning too.
